# Old C stuff
An archive of classic console C code examples, from my early days of programming.
Here is the list of projects:

  <summary><b>Arena</b></summary>
  This game features a user interface menu that offers various options, allowing you to choose the number of enemies and the size of the arena. 
  The objective is to catch all the monsters within the arena, which attempt to escape from you. 
  While the enemies generally move randomly, they will try to flee if you get close enough to catch them.
  Use 'A' and 'D' to move left and right during gameplay. Navigate the menu with 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', and confirm selections with 'Enter'.

  <summary><b>Robots</b></summary>
  This is a simple simulation where robots race to the finish line, avoiding obstacles along the way.

  This feature can be disabled by commenting <code>#define ENT_ENABLED</code> in <a href="/Robots/robot_race.h" target="_blank">robot_race.h</a>.
  No user interaction is needed.
